Flow on the testnet:
    - First we get the subscriptionId from the chainlink vrf site and add it to the helper-hardhat-config.
    - After that we deploy the contract on testnet.
    - Then we take our contracts address and go to the above chainlink vrf site to create a consumer by adding our contract address.
    - After that we go the the chainlink keepers site and by selecting custom logic we create a upkeep.
    - That's it, then we do the staging test on the testnet.
